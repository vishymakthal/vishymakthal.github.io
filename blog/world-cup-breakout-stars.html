			<h4>The World's Biggest Talent Show</h4>
			<p>				The FIFA World Cup is a celebration, sporting spectacle, and global phenomenon. It’s also a catalyst for a meteoric rise in a player's career.
				Players from lesser known clubs and countries have a chance to show their stuff on the world’s biggest footballing stage.
				Club executives and new football fans (such as myself in 2014) alike demand that the summer’s biggest stars from the World Cup be signed for their team.
				Oftenimes, World Cup signings work out well for a team, such as James Rodriguez and Keylor Navas for Real Mardid, Antoine Griezmann for Atletico de Madrid, and Alexis Sanchez for Arsenal.
				A good showing at the World Cup generates buzz. Hashtags, website hits, mentions, and other digital and non-digital media assets. Clubs know that the World Cup sparks
				the most interest in soccer than any other event does, and so signing buzzworthy players is valuable to growing a club's ubiquity and status.
				James Rodriguez went from a decent player at Monaco to the absolute star of the World Cup, garnering the attention of Real Madrid and eventually the number 10 jersey for the Spanish giants.
				There is no doubt we'll see more signings like that happen this summer after the World Cup.

				<br/>
				<br/>

								As the tournament starts to kick off, I'll be taking a crack at predicting this summer’s breakout stars. Not only do I lack the information needed to make accurate predictions, I also do not have any intentions of acquiring said information.
				Let’s get to it!

			</p>
      <h4>Keita Balde - Senegal - FW</h4>

      <p>				Not only does Keita Balde look like a mix between Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx, he's also fast and scores goals. Excellent traits for the modern day winger.
				Balde, who was born in Spain and spent some time in Barcelona's academy as a youngster, already has nearly five years of top-level European
				soccer experience under his belt at 23 years of age. After Barcelona loaned him out as a punishment for playing a prank during a youth tournament, Balde opted to move elsewhere
				and ended up at Lazio, an Italian club based in Rome. He spent the next five years in Rome, before transferring to AS Monaco, where he scored eight goals this past season. Balde's
				young age, experience in Europe, and importance in Senegal's front line make him quite buzzworthy, even more so if Senegal manages to put on a show this summer and makeit out of their group.
      </p>

			<h4>Nicolas Tagliafico - Argentina - LB</h4>
			<img src="./images/Nico_T_InfoCard.PNG" style="max-width:100%; max-height:auto;" />
      <p>				Full disclosure: I don't know much about this guy. This is where my credibility as a soccer hipster is brought to question.
				Ajax, a club based out of the capital city of Amsterdam, is an excellent team capable of performing well in the Champions League. The club is also known for producing some of Europe's best players, such as
			  Tottenham's Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen, Napoli's Arkadiusz Milik (all of whom are also playing in the World Cup), and of course, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, among many others.
				He was touted as the "next Javier Zanetti" (Zanetti is an Argentinian soccer legend). Additionally, Ajax manager Erik ten Hag highly rates Tagliafico, stating that "He's an example of how to defend". An exemplary defender as some would say.
				The Jrue Holiday of soccer. The fact that he comes from a club known for producing Europe's best players, and that he has been assigned the kit number 3, the number that a first-choice left back wears, I can
				objectively deduce that Tagliafico will be one of many who see their careers launched by the World Cup.
      </p>
			<br/>
			<h4>Hirving Lozano - Mexico - FW</h4>
			<img src="./images/H_Lozano_MEX.PNG" style="max-width:100%; max-height:auto;" />
      <p>				My next prediction also plays in the talent factory that is the Dutch first division. Hirving "Chucky" Lozano is probably Mexico's most exciting player.
				 On a side note, I'd also be on the lookout this summer for his compratriots Jesus Manuel Corona, Jose de Jesus Corona, and Corona Extra. With his wide grin
				 and history of scaring his roommates during his academy days, Lozano seemed perfect for the role of a horror movie antagonist, particularly the movie "Childs Play",
				 hence his nickname "Chucky". He's also pretty damn scary on the pitch too. The madman scored 19 goals in 34 apperances this past season with PSV Eindhoven. If he can carry that form
				 into the World Cup, he is definitely going to be on the transfer target list for some European giants. It's also worth noting that his agent is the infamous Mino Raiola, whose clientele includes
				 superstars Paul Pogba (France), Romelu Lukaku (Belgium), Mario Balotelli (Italy), and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Sweden). This young lad is set not only for a promising soccer career,
				 but also some lucrative contracts and flashy Nike advertisements.
