    description = "**Vishy Makthal** is a comedian and writer from **Raleigh, NC**. Currently based in **New York City**, he was born in **Hyderabad, India** and was raised there and in the Triangle. As a South Indian from the South, Vishy's clashing identities have left him with a penchant for **sharp observational humor** and a liking for Bojangles with Dal Chawal. He's performed on shows across the country (**Goodnights Comedy Club**, **Broadway Comedy Club**) and abroad, having been featured in India and Europe. Heâ€™s also kind of tall."
